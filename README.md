Implement Consumer and Producer
Please implement a consumer and producer model. You should firstly initiate three queues with random lengths. And then, you should create a producer that continuously creates items and put them into the shortest queue (randomly pick one if there are multiple shortest ones). You should create three consumers which only consumes its own queue. Print to the console whenever consumer queues change.
